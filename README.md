# SQL-Assessments-Project


## Overview
This project contains **three SQL assessment tasks**.  
Each task creates a database, builds tables, loads data, and performs queries for analysis.  
The goal is to practice database creation, data exploration, and analytical queries in SQL.



## Assessments

### **Assessment 1: Sales Orders Database**
- Creates normalized tables (`customer`, `product`, `region`, `sales_orders`).  
- Loads data from `sales_order.csv`.  
- Performs queries to:  
  - Explore products, regions, and customers.  
  - Join all tables to view full sales order details.  

### **Assessment 2: Pet Owners Database**
- Creates tables for `owners` and `pet_s`.  
- Queries include:  
  - Finding oldest dogs and their owners.  
  - Listing all owners (with or without pets).  
  - Counting pets owned by each person.  

### **Assessment 3: Templar HR Database**
- Creates `templarHR` table and loads data from `TemplarHR.csv`.  
- Queries include:  
  - Comparing salaries by gender and department.  
  - Analyzing pay by minority status and job level.  
  - Checking pay differences across departments for same job titles.
